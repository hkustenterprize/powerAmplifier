# powerAmplifier
Prototype single channel power sensing module for sentry  


## Hardware
Sensing power with STM32F373 SDADC and precision frontend.  
Low side shunt current measurement topology.  
Schematics available in Alex Wong's brain, open singlePowerAmp.ioc with STM32CubeMx to see STM32 connections.  
Be careful with the input and output direction, also the power polarity. Try not to mess with the XT60 leads attatched to the screw terminals.  
Hardware draws power from the main power input, but does not measure the current used by itself.  
  
## Software  
Current software writen uses STM32Cube HAL, generated by STM32CubeMx.  
Voltage and current measured at 50kHz and down sampled to 1kHz with software oversampling to improve SNR.  
Firmware runs bare-metal (no RTOS).
